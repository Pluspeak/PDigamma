Description: Implements the Power-Denominator Digamma (PDigamma) distribution 
    family for regression modeling of heavy-tailed count data. Provides 
    tail-index regression within a pure discrete framework, with particular 
    focus on insurance claims, catastrophe modeling, and extreme event 
    frequency analysis. Features include: (1) explicit tail index regression 
    via heteroscedastic parameter modeling; (2) EM algorithm with hard 
    boundary projection for constrained maximum likelihood; (3) adaptive 
    m-out-of-n bootstrap for valid inference in infinite variance regimes; 
    (4) Sibuya boundary diagnostics and mixed extreme value inference 
    protocols. The package fills the gap between exponential-tailed models 
    (Poisson, Negative Binomial) and fixed power-law models (Zeta) by 
    allowing covariate-dependent tail heaviness.
